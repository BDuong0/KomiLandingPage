                <p>This anime got a special place in my heart. I remember watching the Season 2 trailer for the anime while I was in my senior year of high school. I would sit in the lunch room when I had study hall for one of my classes for the day during my last semester of high school and watch anime clips on YouTube. The opening of the Season 1 anime called 'Cinderella' gives my goosebumps everytime I listen to it because it represents to me, "be able to be happy alone and you know you will find your people someday".I had a really big crush on this girl in my senior year of my high school and I would listen to 'Cinderella' a lot when I got off from school and went home from orchestra concerts because it helped me soothe my emotional attachment of missing my crush after highschool. I resonate with Komi because when she was able to befriend lots of people, I saw many times in the anime were Komi realizes that she is a worthy person to befriend and I just though there were many moments in the series were Komi is seen enjoying herself because she has found her people. If you see the progression of the friends Komi's had throughout the manga, you would be proud of her. I'm similar to Komi because in my senior year, I too finally found 'my people', which in reality were just 2 friends, but those to fit the bill perfectly for what I define as a friend. My two lifelong friends are Ish and Marko. They are people that actually spent time hanging out with in and outside of school. I actually have conversations with them that aren't small talk that you make to acquaintances.</p>
