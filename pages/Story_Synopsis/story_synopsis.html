Her mere presence makes everyone go "Owoo" and "Ahhh". Students are overly enthusiastic over every minute thing Komi does. Komi goes write sher name on the chalk board, everyone goes freaking nuts. You got guys and girls wheezing over here because of the mere precense of Komi in their classroom. Don't get me talking about the people who in the same class as Shouko. Everyone got their eyes on Komi because she gets everyone's attention despite having a cold ice queen type of vibe about herself. Until one day a certain encounter between Komi and a boy would uncover the secret of Shouko Komi. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="splScrn-group"> <div class="splScrn-group__img"> <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonbastardbrigade.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F06%2FKomi-Cant-Communicate-1-1-401x600.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=0daff540e7d5d45e98a5b8658987ef1c8a75672fec9edcdd34ffb05c02f92040&ipo=images"> </div> <div class="splScrn-group__content-wrap"> <div class="splScrn-group__content"> <h1 class="ff-accent fw-bold">Enter Tadano Hitohito</h1> <p class="ff-body fw-regular">Right off the bat, we are introduced to a plain looking guy named Tadano. The manga even says that Tadano is just some "ordinary" guy and Tadano says to himself to "Read the room and make sure to stay away from trouble". First day of school Tadano is sat right next to Komi in the same classroom. Everyone else in the classroom are watching Tadano like vultures, waiting to jump Tadano's ass if he tries anything to get closer to Komi-san. One day he encounters Komi-san in a classroom. For some reason, Tadano has trouble talking to Komi. In an attempt to escape the awkward interaction Komi tries to run out of the classroom but Tadano says something that makes Komi stop right in her tracks. He asks Komi if she has trouble speaking to others. At this point we are introduced to one of Komi's mannerisms which is stuttering repetitively as she tries to talk to speak</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="splScrn-group"> <div class="splScrn-group__img"> <img src="https://cdn.mangaclash.com/manga_5f2d136352121/16cbaf759a03d05ddf02b5515333cea3/5.jpg"> </div> <div class="splScrn-group__content-wrap"> <div class="splScrn-group__content"> <h1 class="ff-accent fw-bold">Komi's Secret</h1> <p class="ff-body fw-regular">It turns out that Komi has a communication disorder where it's really difficult for Komi to talk to other people. The way Komi talk's to Tadano is by writing what she wants to say on a notepad or anywhere else like on a chalk board. Komi starts 'talking' to Tadano about her difficulty with communicating to others. She talks about how she can't do simple things like greet people, say hi, and talking about your feelings. Komi says that when she tries to talk to people her face tenses up because she gets scared and peoples' reaction to that is to beg and kneel on their knees or run away. The sad thing Komi also says is she eats her lunch alone and is envious of people who get to eat their lunch with their friends. Komi laments about if her life will be like this forever. After Komi is done talking she tries to exit the classroom and asks Tadano to forget about their conversation, but then something unexpectantly heartwarming happens.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="splScrn-group"> <div class="splScrn-group__img"> <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fih1.redbubble.net%2Fimage.1093673460.6309%2Fbg%2Cf8f8f8-flat%2C750x%2C075%2Cf-pad%2C750x1000%2Cf8f8f8.u1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=07b017a38f6b30daa2a4b7d073047751fdab631cad0cfa8f0ba9a22d9cc58c8c&ipo=images"> </div> <div class="splScrn-group__content-wrap"> <div class="splScrn-group__content"> <h1 class="ff-accent fw-bold">Heartwarming Moment</h1> <p class="ff-body fw-regular">Tadano starts writing on the chalk board and Komi decides to stay and talk with Tadano.
